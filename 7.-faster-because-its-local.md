# 7. Faster Because Its Local

We will offer browser extensions \(using the [WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions)\) which individuals can install \(if desired\). These will sync down data that can be used to expedite the queries of an individual user \(e.g., if the user has an account this could include their previous queries\).

We also believe that these web extensions could provide a robust replacement for browser bookmarks which have long languished from lack of attention and that, with the user's permissions, these bookmarks could also become valuable in ranking results \(again, we would use the trust network to weigh the influence bookmarks could play\).

The extension might also provide functionality similar to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) and [Diigo](https://diigo.com/) - e.g., save for later, highlights, annotations.
