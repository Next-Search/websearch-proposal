# 3.0 You Own Your Data

We will offer built-in hosting for your search data to make the user experience as smooth as possible BUT you won't be stuck with us. You'll be able to choose from a number of data storage hosts such as [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/), [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com), [Box](https://www.box.com/), and [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/). In fact you'll be able to store your data in almost any secure location whether that is a [SOLID Pod](https://solid.inrupt.com/), [Blockstack's Gaia](https://github.com/blockstack/gaia), or your own personal server.\[^1\]

We'll implement this data in an open format\[^2\] that other sources \(if you so choose\) can consume and hope to see search providers adding ingestion capabilities to their services for individuals who may want to move to a new service \(or sync between services\).

\[^1\]: For more information on this topic see [unhosted web apps](https://unhosted.org/). [remoteStorage](https://remotestorage.io/) is a specific implementation that already supports a number of hosts.  
\[^2\]: For example, an implementation using [RDF and JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp/wiki/RDF_AND_JSON-LD_UseCases) might work. See also the Wikipedia articles on the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) and [Resource Description Format \(RDF\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework).
