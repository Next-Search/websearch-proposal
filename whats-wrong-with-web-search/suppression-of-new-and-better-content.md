# Suppression of New \(and Better\) Content

Search engines do not intentionally suppress new and better sites/content \(to the best of our knowledge\) but it is the inevitable result of the algorithms currently used to calculate search result rankings.

Sites which have existed for a long period of time and/or have a large number of incoming high quality links have a significant edge over newer sites - even when these newer sites are providing noticeably better content.

This discourages many who create content on the web as they see months and even years pass without their work receiving any significant attention. Sites are often abandoned long before they appear highly in the search results and high quality content is lost to the world.
