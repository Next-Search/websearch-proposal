# Poor Searcher Productivity

Search engines lack a number of simple and intuitive tools that could significantly improve a searcher's productivity. Some examples include:

* Relatively limited qualifier options for refining queries \(and the limited options are usually not in a form most users will utilize, e.g. hidden on an invisible advanced search form or using operators\).
* Inability to filter out or prioritize certain results for specific queries without knowing in advance what should/should not exist.
* Inability to share easily one's own research on a topic with others.

The depths of this problem become more evident whenever someone is performing research or seeking information regarding a topic that is not part of popular culture or some significant niche.
