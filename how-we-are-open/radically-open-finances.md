# Open Finances

We want to be transparent with you about our finances and how we are utilizing them. We don't have anything to be ashamed of so we will be making available detailed reports of our income and expenditures on at least a quarterly basis.

Are we going on frequent lavish retreats? Are we purchasing private jets? Using company finances for personal expenses? Treating employees poorly? Giving executives unreasonable pay? Failing to appropriate enough funds to improving the engine? We won't and we want you to be able to hold us accountable!

Since we aren't a public company our actual financial reporting requirements are limited BUT we'd rather you know all about us.
