# Lack of Competition

Google owns the vast majority of the web search market. When a single company dominates any market it often results in:

* An Inferior Product - Since competition is not constantly spurring innovation it is easy for products/services to stagnate.
  * Even if a company is pushing forward with innovation the lack of competitors using innovative methods to improve search may result in a myopic product focused on micro gains within existing technologies.
* Inferior Customer Service - Since there is no alternative, customers are forced to work with the company on it's terms.

{% hint style="info" %}
We are aware of several robust competitors to Google including Bing and DuckDuckGo. We believe they are doing great work BUT that they are competing with Google within it's own paradigm and that this will be ultimately unsuccessful. Thus we still see a space for other competitors like us.
