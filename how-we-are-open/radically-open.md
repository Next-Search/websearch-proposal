# Radically Open

We love open source. To be a consumer of a product/service with no leverage to encourage the producer to improve their offering can leave us feeling helpless and have a real negative effect upon quality of life. 

Open source is beautiful for many reasons but lets just talk about one of them - the ability to forge ahead even when the original producer refuses to do so. If you don't like the way an open source product/service is being offered, you can utilize the existing product to create something even better.

This forces the original producer to either innovate to match/exceed the new offering or watch as their users \(for good reason\) leave for the better option.

In the next several pages we will discuss specific ways in which we will be radically open which we believe will force us to be accountable to our consumers and thus spur constant innovation, humility, and responsiveness.
