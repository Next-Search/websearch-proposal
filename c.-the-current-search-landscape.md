# C. The Current Search Landscape

## Introduction

Everyone knows Google is the big name in search, followed distantly by Bing. But what about the rest of the search landscape? Are there other competitors out there? If so, are they attempting anything similar to NeSE or do they have other innovative ways of improving search results that might eliminate the need for NeSE?

This appendix attempts to address these questions and to provide a fairly thorough evaluation of the currently available search options. Feel free to skip on to the lists of search engines below but we also wanted to provide some information on our methodology for those who may be interested why certain sites do and don't appear on this list.

We'd love to hear from you if we've missed any engines or if you have reasons why we've miscategorized an engine. You can reach us via [twitter @nextwebsearch](https://twitter.com/nextwebsearch) or via email at nextsearch@protonmail.com.

## Methodology

The search landscape is not unitary and straightforward. That is, one is often not comparing apples to apples when looking at different search engines. For example:

* Some search engines have a tremendous user base and pose a signficant challenger to any new search entrant while other search engines are quite small and unknown.
* Some search engines handle what are considered to be the three core aspects of web search: \(1\) a crawler \(that finds and indexes sites\), \(2\) the index \(which contains indexed sites, assigned rankings, relationships, etc.\) and \(3\) the search interface \(the website through which a user makes a search query\).
* Other search engines only implement some of the three outlined above. This usually occurs when a search engine provides a unique interface but behind the scenes is drawing on the index of another engine. [Mojeek's Search Engine Map](https://www.searchenginemap.com/) provides a helpful visualization of the various search engines and how they relate to one another.
* Among these search engines pulling from other engines' indexes there are some that essentially provide the results almost exactly as provided to them and others who run their own algorithms on top of the base index to improve the results further.
* Some search engines are "meta" - that is they query against multiple other search engines, sometimes combining the results to determine their own unique ranking.
* And technically, there are many search engines outside of web search - there are local site searches \(e.g., searching for articles on Wikipedia\), vertical search sites \(that cover a limited number of topics\), and so on.
* Finally, there are search directories which may cover all topics but where the results are usually limited and often human curated.

To make our review of the landscape finite we will focus on two types of sites:

1. Those that are highly popular.
2. Those which bring unique functionality to the table.

This affects our survey in two significant ways:

1. Sites which are somewhat popular AND don't offer unique functionality will not be represented in a meaningful way. This means, for example, that while we include DuckDuckGo in our contenders listings a number of other less popular privacy engines aren't addressed due to their functionality being available in DDG. Examples of sites that fell under this exclusion include Searchalot, Gibiru, DiscreteSearch, etc.
2. Sites which are highly popular but are no longer considered serious search contenders. You can look at Appendix B to see a bit about the history of search engines and the various acquisitions that occurred. Oftentimes these acquisitions resulted in the acquired becoming a shell of its own self. 

We've provided additional footnotes regarding why certain sites are/are not on the list below.

* Specific Countries / Cultures / Languages:
  * [Baidu](https://baidu.com/) - China. \(Alexa Rank: [\#4](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/baidu.com), 12/2019\)
  * [Yandex](https://yandex.com/) - Russia. \(Alexa Rank: [\#50](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/yandex.ru), 12/2019\)

## Second Tier Competitors

* Yahoo \(Alexa Rank: [\#11](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/yahoo.com), 12/2019\)\[^1\]
* Ask \(Alexa Rank: [\#183](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ask.com), 12/2019\)\[^2\]
* Ecosia \(Alexa Rank: [\#378](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ecosia.org), 12/2019\)\[^3\]
* Startpage \(Alexa Rank: [\#1574](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/startpage.com), 12/2019\)\[^4\]
* SearchEncrypt \(Alexa Rank: [\#4412](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/searchencrypt.com), 12/2019\)\[^5\[
* Qwant \(Alexa Rank: [\#5466](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/qwant.com), 12/2019\)\[^6\]
* Dogpile \(Alexa Rank: [\#33400](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/dogpile.com), 12/2019\)\[^7\]
* Gigablast \(Alexa Rank: [\#61545](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/gigablast.com), 12/2019\)\[^8\]
* Metager \(German, Alexa Rank: [\#86032](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/metager.de), 12/2019\)\[^9\]
* [Yippy](https://yippy.com/) \(Alexa Rank: [\#114921](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/yippy.com), 12/2019\)\[^10\]

## The Rest

* Not in Top 130,000 \(12/2019\) - None of the below sites are within the top 130k sites according to Alexa. We may move Searx \(open source\) and Mojeek \(unique index\) onto our list of contenders after further evaluation. Most of the other sites are privacy oriented sites that don't show significant differentiation from DDG.
  * Searchalot, AlltheInternet, Searx, Gibiru, Disconnect, Swisscows, Lukol, Oscobo, DiscreteSearch, Mojeek, HotBot

## Footnotes

\[^1\]: While Yahoo is extremely high traffic it has long outsourced its search results to Bing and we are not aware of any major innovations being implemented on top of those Bing results. We've included Yahoo in second tier due to its high traffic and the fact that it could quickly become a significant player if it chose to augment Bing's results or implement its own engine again.  
\[^2\]: Ask is a similar situation to Yahoo, its results are pulled from Google and we don't see significant innovation on top of those results. However, like Yahoo, they could quickly become a significant player if they focused on search again.  
\[^3\]: Ecosia draws its results from Bing. If it wasn't for its high traffic it might not be included on this list - but its traffic and its earth-friendly / social good focus make it unique enough to stand apart from the rest.  
\[^4\]: Startpage uses Google results, is similar DDG, but has enough traffic to make it a potentially serious competitor.  
\[^5\]: Search Encrypt is similar to Startpage and DDG. It uses Bing for results and again is listed because of its high traffic.  
\[^6\]: Qwant uses Bing results to supplement its own index. It has high traffic, was founded outside the United States, and offers a Boards application which allows for sharing and annotating web content.  
\[^7\]: Dogpile is a meta search engine, one of the older engines on the net. It doesn't seem to be particularly distinguished from others but could probably offer competition if it placed energies towards significant innovation.  
\[^8\]: Gigablast could easily have been excluded from this list. It appears to have stagnated to a large extent.  
\[^9\]: Metager, while not the highest trafficked apparently pulls results from numerous search engines \(aka, it is meta\), is from outside the US \(Germany\), and offers some helpful customization options for results. In addition it is a non-profit organization, has [released its source code as open source](https://gitlab.metager.de/open-source/MetaGer), and offers privacy. Fairly impressive!  
\[^10\]: Yippy is powered by IBM Watson, uses Bing for at least some of tis results, its most interesting feature is its ability to cluster results into topics - e.g., searching for "Civil War" one might be interested in the American Civil War, the comic book movie, a civil war in another country, etc. Yippy helps one quickly filter out irrelevant results.
