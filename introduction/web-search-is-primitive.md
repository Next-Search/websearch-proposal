# Web Search is Primitive

Web search has improved significantly over the past several decades. However, web search is **still inadequate** for the needs of humanity. This document outlines our proposal for a next generation web search engine that will come much closer to providing  search that meets humanity's needs.

Some say that Google is unbeatable. That their size and tech makes competition \(especially from a small organization\) impossible. To an extent, we agree. Competing search engines will die out or be relegated to a niche audience as long as they compete with Google using the same methods and paradigms that Google is utilizing.

We have something different to offer, please read on.
