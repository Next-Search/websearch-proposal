# C.1. DuckDuckGo

Here we provide an overview of the services offered by DDG as well as where we believe it's weaknesses lie.

## Statistics

## Features

* Strong emphasis on user privacy.

* Have a browser extension.
* Have a mobile app.
* [Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) allow one to quickly search specific sites for content.

## Limitations

* Privacy Only - See section below for details.
* [Partial OSS](https://help.duckduckgo.com/open-source/opensource-overview/) - A significant portion of DDG is not OSS.
* Data Not Open - Unlike NeSE, the data undergirding DDG is not open.
* [Algorithm Not Open](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/rankings/) - There does not appear to be any publicly accessible copy of the algorithm used to rank search results.
* Non-Collaborative - Is not using the explicit input of users to help facilitate the best search results.

### Privacy Only

One of the best features of DDG is its privacy focus - but this is also one of its greatest weaknesses. Much is lost when we are unable to provide more information about ourselves and our interests to gain more relevant results. DDG does have a limited ability to [save some preferences to the cloud](https://duckduckgo.com/settings), but this is quite limited.
