# E. FAQ

## Q. What is to prevent Google or Bing from implementing your proposal if it sees some success thus negating the need for NeSE?

In general we aren't interested in hobbling competition. In the case of Google and Bing in particular we are looking at ways in which we could limit these companies ability to utilize the data we aggregate and the tools we create for a limited time duration \(perhaps 2 years\). This wouldn't prevent Google or Bing from implementing similar features but it would prevent wholesale copying.

## Q. Aren't you worried someone will take your ideas and implement them before you can?

No, not particularly, because:

* We have shared some of these ideas publicly \(over a period of years\) in the past in various public forums and they have not been implemented.
* Our proposal is high level, most of the implementation details would still need to be determined by a third party.
* Our primary goal is to see such a search engine become available, if this occurs at another's hands, so be it.

## Q. Will you be a non-profit or for-profit company?

We are working through the details of our legal structure. Becoming a non-profit is certainly on the table. No matter what legal structure you may assume we intend to make a legally binding contract with the public that ensures that the organization operates in the public's interest both in the near-term and long-term.

For example, one common pattern with search engines has been growing popularity resulting in acquisition. After acquisition much of the original vision and functionality is usually lost. We aren't looking to be acquired but intend to build out robust rules under which such an acquisition could occur to ensure the integrity of our principles and the continued beenfit to the public of our service.
