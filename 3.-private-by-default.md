# 3. Private By Default

We have some pretty radical ideas about the future of search that we'll talk about soon but before we do lets make clear our position on privacy.

As an end user you will be able to use the search engine anonymously. We won't follow you around the web or try to deviously discover who you really are. Some functionality \(such as using your own storage for query data\) will require an account but this account can be anonymous and not tied to other identifiable accounts - we'd like to imitate [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) on this front.

You will be able to take your data with you and we will purge it from our systems to the fullest extent allowed by the law.

We want our privacy to be best-in-class and would love to hear from you ways in which we can explicitly document and demonstrate our commitment to your privacy.
