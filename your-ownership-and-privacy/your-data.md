# Your Data

You will be able to choose **if and where** your data is stored.

If you want complete privacy we won't store your query data.

If you want the benefits that come with having your queries saved, you'll be able to choose the storage provider you want to host your data.

* Only on your local machine
* On our servers \(no charge\)
* On a third party storage service \(Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive\)
* On a self-hosted solution \(perhaps a [SOLID Pod](https://solid.inrupt.com/), [Blockstack's Gaia](https://github.com/blockstack/gaia), or your own personal NAS\).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are more on the technical side of things check out [unhosted web apps](https://unhosted.org/) and [remoteStorage](https://remotestorage.io/) as well.
{% endhint %}

If you want your data it will be readily available for export. We will make sure the exported data is in a form easily consumable by human and machine readers \(e.g. JSON\) so that other services can easily consume this data \(if you want them to\) to improve their services to you.
