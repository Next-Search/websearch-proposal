# Poor Searcher Productivity

Search engines lack many simple and intuitive tools that could significantly improve a searcher's productivity. For example:

* Relatively limited qualifier options for refining queries \(and the limited options are usually not in a form most users will utilize\).
* Inability to filter out or prioritize in certain results for specific queries without knowing in advance what should/should not exist.
* Inability to share easily ones own research on a topic with others.
