# Introduction

## Our Contention: Web Search is Primitive

Everyone knows that [Google](https://google.com/) rules the world when it comes to internet search. Sure, Microsoft has [Bing](https://bing.com/) but it isn't expected to pose a real threat to Google's world domination...and while privacy-centric search engines such as [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) are seeing a surge in traffic they aren't expected to pose a real challenge to Google either.

Many would say that this is because Google is _the best_ at what it does. That they have combined the lessons learned over the past thirty years to create a search engine that cannot be significantly improved on. **That is a load of crap**.

Throughout our proposal we will elucidate the ways in which Google is weak and the ways in which the search engine of the future can blow Google out of the water.

At this point in time we are looking to garner feedback on our proposal - consider it a Request For Comments \(RFC\) - so that we can refine and improve upon our proposal. We don't claim to know the perfect way to create a search engine...but we are confident we can build one much better than Google.\[^1\]

\[^1\]We have great admiration for the geniuses over at Google but believe that the business suffers from some fundamental flaws.
