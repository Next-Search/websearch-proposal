# The Team

The pseudonymous [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) saw great success in making Bitcoin a powerful philosophy/technology. We figured being anonymous might work for NeSE as well!

Okay, not really. We have every intention of revealing our identities but we are going to hold out a while longer for two reasons:

1. We want our proposal to be judged on its merits and not personalities.
2. We are still building out the team and want to present our best look when we drop the veil.

If you believe you'd be a good fit for our team we'd love to hear from you at nextsearch@protonmail.com. Thanks for your patience in the meantime. :-\)
