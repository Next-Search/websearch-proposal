# 1. For the Public Good

We will be a company built for the public good. We are currently seeking to understand the best model for our particular purpose, this includes research into social enterprise / public good / non-profit organizational models.

While we don't have all the details about how we will be organized cemented we can tell you a lot about some of the ways in which, no matter the legal structure, we intend to be for the public benefit.

## How a Search Engine Can Be for the Public Good

* While not every search will be about improving the world many will be - the better the results provided the more we can amplify the productivity of the searcher. 
* By significantly reducing the amount of bad actors that make their way into search results we can keep people safer - e.g., making it harder for scammers to lure vulnerable individuals into unwise schemes.
* By providing the data and tools openly we will facilitate further technological developments that will also carry benefits for the public good.
* We will provide a simple way for individuals to secure at least some income by contributing to the search engine.
* We will model a corporate culture which emphasizes employee care, customer service, and social responsibility.
* The list goes on...Is there a way you think we can be for the public good that we should add to this list?
