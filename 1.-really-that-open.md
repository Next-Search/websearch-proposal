# 2. No Really, That Open

The Next Web Search Engine \(lets call it NeSE for short\) will be radically open. We love open source and what we make will be open source at multiple levels.

### Software

The tools we use to build NeSE will be open source from the crawler to the index storage solution. Some of this software we will build out ourselves, other software will be drawn from existing \(and excellent\) open source projects.

We will do our best not only to share what we make on our own but also to contribute back to the communities who provide software we utilize. We will intentionally support not only the high visibility projects but also the low visibility ones - the systems tools, one person developments, etc. that often go unnoticed.

### Algorithm

Want to understand why our results are ordered as they are? NeSe's algorithm will be fully transparent and available.

We aren't fond of politically/financially/ethnically/etc. biased results and we want our algorithm to show you how we rank...and to have your help in eliminating any unintentional bias that might slip in!

### Data

The aggregate data that we parse through our algorithm to rank our search results will also be open and available.

Wait a second, why did we say _aggregate_? We aren't trying to hold proprietary data, instead we are concerned ensuring our user's privacy. We've seen from blockchain how _anonymous_ protocols become _semi-anonymous_ when each transaction by an individual account is public. We want you to feel confident that your search queries are not going to be revealed to others, even in an anonymized form.

We'd love to find a way to truly share the detailed data anonymously - if you know if a way, let us know! But until such a trustworthy and economical solution can be found we won't be sharing detailed data...well, lets caveat that.

As an end user of the search engine you will have the option to choose whether your detailed interaction data can be shared anonymously or not...and we will share this detailed data openly but by default all accounts will disallow detailed data sharing.
