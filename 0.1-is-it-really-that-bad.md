# 0.1 Is It Really That Bad?

Maybe you have some doubts about our contention that current search technology is not sufficient and that disruption needs to take place in this sector. Google _feels_ good enough for you. We'd like to offer just a few example searches you can try on any major search engine which will return markedly sub-par results.

1. "History of Search Engines" \(or some variant thereof\) - Note how top results often include articles on SEO history \(not search engines proper\) AND how often the "history" available is fairly sparse and obviously listed highly due to SEO by the website owner.
2. "Best Refrigerators" or "Best TV's" or "Best Tables" or "Best of" any tangible product. - Note how the top results usually include at least one paywalled site AND how many of the reviews come from sites that lack transparency on regarding the motivations of their owners. Ohh sure, they may be slick - but is it all about the affiliate revenue?
3. Try doing a few searches with specific technical error messages. We don't know about you, but we've repeatedly ended up with no results returned or results that are simply recapitulations of the same content over and over.

Obviously in the third case we are getting a little specific, but in the other two cases we are talking about common searches folks should be able to make without worrying about illegitimate or poor quality results.
