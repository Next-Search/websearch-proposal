Some say that Google is unbeatable. That their size and tech makes competition \(especially from a small organization\) impossible. To an extent, we agree. Competing search engines will die out or be relegated to a niche audience _as long as_ they compete with Google using the same methods and paradigms that Google is utilizing.

We have something different to offer, please read on.
