# Overview

The following appendixes are useful but not necessary reading for those seeking to understand the next generation web search proposal. We have sought to keep the substance of the proposal limited in extent but hope some will find these additional sections useful.

* [Making a Better World](making-a-better-world.md)
  * Discusses ways in which we see this new search engine as being an important contribution to humanity.
* [Outside Initial Scope](outside-initial-scope.md)
  * Ideas we hope to implement eventually but will not be included in the initial scope of the project. We want to release something robust yet quickly to the world.
* [History of Web Search](https://github.com/nextsearch/HistoryOfWebSearch)
  * A separate document in which we have begun collecting data about the history of web search as its current level of documentation has seemed quite limited.
* [The Current Search Landscape](https://github.com/nextsearch/CurrentSearchLandscape)
  * A review of what the current search landscape looks like, major players, etc.
