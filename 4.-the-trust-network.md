# 5.0 The Trust Network

## Introduction

The greatest challenge for any search engine is in ensuring that the results shown to the end user are the best results available. Over time the methods by which results are ranked have evolved many times over.

Search Engines have ordered pages by the date they were crawled, alphabetically, based on developer included meta tags, keyword density, implicit and explicit search actions by users...and the list goes on.

Some of the improvements made to result quality calculations have been about understanding the content itself but much of the effort has been spent trying to outsmart marketers and malicious actors who attempt to game the results and ensure their product/service/site is shown at the top of the rankings.

We believe The Trust Network can significantly improve the quality of results while decreasing the spamminess of results. How? We are so glad you asked!

## Account Types That Protect Privacy, Facilitate Sharing

As we mentioned in [Private by Default](3.-private-by-default.md) we are serious about your privacy. Your privacy is maintained by offering multiple types of protection:

### Complete Anonymity

No need to register for an account and we won't follow you around or attempt to snoop out your identity.

### Anonymous Account

You have an account but your account isn't tied to any identifiable information - e.g., a phone number, email address, or legal name.

### Private Account

You have an account linked to identifiable information but your settings are such that only you can view your account and its data.

### Selectively Private Account

You can use a set of granular control to determine what you want to share and what you want to keep private.

### Entirely Public Account

By default your data is shared publicly but you have the option of disabling sharing on specific data.

## Calculating Trust

"_all individuals are given the opportunity to participate, but their influence is based on publicly earned merit – what they contribute to the community._" - [The Apache Way](http://www.apache.org/theapacheway/)
{% endhint %}

NeSE uses accounts to attribute value to an individuals explicit and implicit feedback on results quality and how we integrate it into our algorithmic ranking process.\[^1\] If we stopped here we'd be susceptible to manipulation just like other search engines...so we don't stop there, we add the trust network layer.

### How an Authority Score Increases

NeSE provides each user \(excluding anonymous users\) with an authority score. This starts quite low and can be increased over time through four methods:

1. A trusted user explicitly trusts your account.
2. You provide substantive contributions over time to the engine \(explicitly and/or implicitly, with the former carrying significantly more weight than the latter\).
3. You verify your identity in ways that ensure you are an actual individual making legitimate contributions.
4. You verify your credentials on a specific topic.\[^2\]

### How We Prevent Gaming of Authority Scores

If we stop here we are _still_ susceptible to manipulation, individuals and/or machines can open accounts and increase their authority by granting trust to one another. That is why we take things yet a step further:

When an individual account trusts another account, the trusting account's reputation becomes linked to the grantee account's reputation. If the grantor account trusts a spammy grantee account the grantor will take a hit to its own reputation just as the spammy grantee does. The negative hit increases exponentially - that is, initially it may only be a few points off the authority score but as the number of related accounts performing detrimental actions increases we use a multiplier to rapidly deduct from the trusting user's authority.

This linkage need not be only first level trusts. For example, if JohnDoe trusts JaneDoe who trusts IAmSpammy, not only will JaneDoe take a hit but JohnDoe will as well, though the impact on JohnDoe will be significantly less than that on JaneDoe.

This doesn't make us impervious to manipulation but it will make manipulation much harder. In order to gain authority one has to provide value and build relationships. To build relationships others must trust you to an extent where they are willing to suffer penalty if you behave poorly.

It is likely that malicious activity will still occur through account compromises, but using the trust network we should be able to quickly isolate the impact of such manipulation and \(hopefully\) restore account access to the appropriate individual. That is, when a trusted user begins performing or being linked to negative behavior this is likely a sign that the individual's account has been compromised.

## More on Identity

The Trust Network depends heavily on identity and this is a topic we are not experts in, so we are working to improve our understanding of the available options. We don't necessarily want to create an entire identity infrastructure if there are standards based approaches that we can utilize.

\[^1\]: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)/StackExchange are a model of explicit behavior being used to grant authority. Not surprisingly, [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) is another great model.  
\[^2\]: For example, an individual who is a professor in history at a accredited university might receive some trust on that topic due to their verifiable expertise. Similarly, someone who works for a company might receive some trust associated specifically with information regarding that company. Other areas that might lend themselves to this sort of crediting of trust include book/journal authorship, owning/contributing to respected site on x topic, etc.
