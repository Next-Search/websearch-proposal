# FAQ

## Q. What is to prevent Google or Bing from implementing your proposal if it sees some success thus negating the need for NeSE?

In general we aren't interested in hobbling competition. In the case of Google and Bing in particular we are looking at ways in which we could limit these companies ability to utilize the data we aggregate and the tools we create for a limited time duration \(perhaps 2 years\). This wouldn't prevent Google or Bing from implementing similar features but it would prevent wholesale copying.

## Q. Aren't you worried someone will take your ideas and implement them before you can?

No, not particularly, because:

* We have shared some of these ideas publicly \(over a period of years\) in the past in various public forums and they have not been implemented.
* Our proposal is high level, most of the implementation details are still undefined.
