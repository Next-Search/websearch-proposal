# Open Algorithms

Search Engines utilize complex algorithms to rank the search results that are displayed to consumers. Generally the intricacies of these algorithms are hidden from consumers for a variety of reasons. We will not be taking a closed approach and instead will make our algorithms available and open source.

We want others to be able to utilize our algorithms in their own engines. We also believe that feedback from the community will be a key component of improving our algorithm over time.
