# Lack of Privacy

The amount of data being retained by technology companies about us has been a growing concern. What data is being collected? How is it being used? Is it being shared or sold to other parties?

We recognize that a number of search engines are working to improve user privacy currently. We believe this is a significant and pressing concern and ensuring user privacy will be a central focus of our platform BUT it is not the distinctive value proposition we offer. We also believe that search engines attempting to acquire market share from Google based primarily on improved user privacy will see limited success.
