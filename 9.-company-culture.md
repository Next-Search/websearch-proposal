# 10.0 Company Culture

We want to be intentional about company culture from the start. We believe that the most valuable and profitable companies in the long-run are those that are intentional in valuing all stakeholders - employees, investors, customers, humanity. Thus we intend to:

1. Act in a way that respects our customers and seeks to provide true and increasing value.
2. Provide investors with a return on investment that is significant but not at the cost of employee/customer/humanity.
3. Act in a way \(for the betterment of humanity\) that increases and encourages cross-cultural understanding, deep thinking, and wise utilization of resources.
4. Contribute to humanity through the openness of our data and tooling. Not only is this helpful for others but it is helpful for us. Too often companies "rest on their laurels" and fail to improve rapidly due to a lack of competition. We want to always deliver new value, to never say, "that is good enough" and let our service lapse into mediocrity.
5. Take excellent care of all of our employees, without exclusion. 

We are about changing the world of search but we are also about being a positive factor at all levels of existence - and of encouraging others to move in this direction as well. We hope to model a healthy company culture that others will want to imitate and which we admit comes from our admiration of many other companies who are already doing amazing things.
