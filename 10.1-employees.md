# 10.1 Employees

We'd like to, for a few minutes, discuss our last point: care of employees. We believe:

## Minimal Stressors

That employees produce the most value when they have minimal stressors outside their career.

This means providing:

* a living wage\[^1\]
* health benefits \(medical, dental, vision, HSA\)
* 401\(k\) with up to 4% matching
* generous sick/vacation policies
* flexible work schedules
* disability and life insurance policies
* paid parental leave
* equipment stipend
* continuing education stipend
* wellness stipend
* health/comforted-optimized working environments

## Marathon, Not a Sprint

That the tortoise will win the race over the hare and that we do not need to work excessive hours to deliver a quality product that can maintain market dominance over the long haul.

As such we are committed to establishing a 40 hour work week as normative. 

## Invaluable Asset

That employees are an invaluable asset and should be considered before increased financial value for the company.

This means we won't cut employees or employee benefits to "save money" unless absolutely necessary.

## Inherent Value

That each individual has inherent worth and that no one individual can be worth infinitely more than another.

As such, compensation for the lowest paid employee will be directly tied to the maximum compensation available to the highest paid employee.

## Notes

\[^1\]: We plan to evaluate wages on the offerings made by popular non-profit techology companies such as: [Wikimedia Foundation](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Wikimedia-Foundation-Salaries-E38331.htm), [Mozilla](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Mozilla-Salaries-E19129.htm), [Code for America](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Code-for-America-Salaries-E554293.htm), [Code.org](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Code-org-Salaries-E956647.htm),  [TechSoup](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/TechSoup-Salaries-E334218_P2.htm), [PLoS](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/PLOS-Salaries-E319739.htm), [Creative Commons](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Creative-Commons-Salaries-E357361.htm), [OLPC](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/one-laptop-per-child-Salaries-E357756.htm), [Kiva](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Kiva-Salaries-E436370.htm), [Khan Academy](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Khan-Academy-Salaries-E452278.htm), [Internet Archive](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Internet-Archive-Salaries-E267448.htm).  
We don't expect to have a significant difference between what we offer to the higher paid employees but would like to differentiate ourselves in contrast to some non-profit technology companies that pay non-technical/execute roles compensation that we would consider inadequate for a living wage.
