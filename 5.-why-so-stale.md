# 5. Why So Stale?

Modern search engines pride themselves on their almost real-time results. That is, they are quite good at returning results which include activity \(usually in the media or social networks\) that has occurred quite recently. This works moderately well for current events but isn't much help for time unbound queries. For example: searching for a historical event, a technical tutorial, a scientific article, etc.

In these unbound queries the chance that a better and/or newer resource moving up the rankings without signficant expenditure of marketing funds is unlikely. It doesn't matter if you just published the most extensive, most beautiful, best organized site on chemistry in the world - it will languish unless you have money power.

This is extremely unfortunate as it encourages stagnation in the results and discourages effort by would-be contributors who give up before \(maybe\) seeing some traffic result from all their hard work. So how do we fix this?

Individuals and organizations will be able to submit sites to the engine for indexing and ranking. A small number of sites may be submitted for free, additional sites will require a nominal fee \(to discourage spammers form mass submissions\). End users will be able to view recently added sites and vote on the value of such submissions and will be incentivized to do so because:

1. Monetary Incentive - Users who discover new sites of high value will receive a portion of NeSE's revenue associated with that site.\[^1\]
2. Authority Incentive - The discovery of valuable sites is one way to increase one's authority.
3. Discovery Incentive - Everyone loves discovering and sharing something valuable with others.



\[^1\]:[ Quora's partner program](https://www.quora.com/partners) is somewhat akin to what we are envisioning here, although we believe that this particular implementation is flawed and causes an increase in spammy questions.
