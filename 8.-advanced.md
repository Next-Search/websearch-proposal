# 8.0 Advanced Beyond Our Years

We are big believers in offering a simple, intuitive UI but we are also fans of progressive enhancement. Right now the tools available from search engines for performing advanced research are quite limited - we'd like to fix that.

We believe individuals should be able to:

1. Create a "just these sites" list to query that is named and saved across sessions. No need to reenter desired sites every time one queries.
2. Create a "not these sites" list similar to "just these sites."
3. Remove sites from their search results that are not useful to them \(with the option to report the site as low value\).
4. Reorganize search results to reflect the value the results hold for the individual user.
5. Add specific sites to their personal list of preferred results for queries.
6. Choose whether they want the results to include listings they have viewed previously or whether the results should only contain "new to them" results.
7. Assign ranking values to the results of others - e.g., if an individual publicly shares their search data on NeSE an individual should be able to "link to" \(without trusting\) that person's data and have the results altered based on this individual's \(and potentially others\) results.

What other advanced functionality would you like to see?
