## Our Contention: Web Search is Primitive

Everyone knows that [Google](https://google.com/) rules the world when it comes to internet search. Sure, Microsoft has [Bing](https://bing.com/) but it hasn't been able to pose a real threat to Google's world domination. Privacy-centric search engines such as [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) are seeing a large surge in traffic due to growing privacy concerns but are unlikely to dethrone Google as long as better privacy remains their main attraction.\[^1\]

Many would say that this is because Google is _the best_ at what it does. That over the years it has accumulated search algorithms and technologies which cannot be significantly improved upon. That there is no room for a search engine to significantly distinguish itself positively from Google. **That is a load of crap**.

Throughout our proposal we will elucidate the ways in which Google is weak and the ways in which the search engine of the future can blow Google out of the water.

At this point in time we are looking to garner feedback on our proposal - consider it a Request For Comments \(RFC\) - so that we can refine and improve upon our proposal. We don't claim to know the perfect way to create a search engine...but we are confident we can build one that is far superior to what exists today.\[^2\]

\[^1\]: There are several engines for whom we have significant admiration, including DDG. We know that they have other differentiating factors but we believe these are not significant enough to overtake Google.  
\[^2\]: We have great admiration for the geniuses over at Google, they have brought many significant search innovations to the world but we believe that their fundamental reliance on machines as arbitrators of value is misplaced.
