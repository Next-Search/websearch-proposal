# The Next Generation Search Engine Proposal

This document outlines a proposal for a next generation web search engine which we believe can deliver results significantly better than any current search engine.

* \(Current\) 3rd Alpha Release - February 3rd, 2021.
* 2nd Alpha Release - June 1st, 2020.
* 1st Alpha Release - January, 2020.

## 4th Alpha Document
The 4th iteration remains true to the previous incarnations of our proposal as far as content but is being significantly restructured and expanded upon to ensure clarity, conciseness, etc. You can view this document as it evolves. It is available as a [Microsoft Word Document](next-web-search.docx) and as a [Markdown Document](next-web-search.md).

Note that the markdown doc is primarily provided to allow easier visual diffing than is possible with Microsoft Word documents in Git. As such it's formatting is sub-optimal and for pretty formatting you should see the DOCX file.
