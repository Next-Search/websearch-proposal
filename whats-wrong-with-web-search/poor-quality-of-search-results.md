# Poor Quality of Search Results

The results returned by search engines have improved significantly over prior engines BUT are still **abysmal** in so many cases. Disagree? Here are a few simple queries you can make to see the poor quality of current search results:

## Query: History of Search Engines

**Query**: _History of Search Engines_

**Results**: Notice the results that are outdated, poorly presented, have duplicate content, or are covering SEO rather than search engines properly.

## Query: "Best {Product/Service}"

**Query**: _Best {Product/Service}_

* Choose whatever product or service you like - refrigerator, laptop, bed, headphones, etc.

**Results**:

* Most reviews come from "big entity" sites - the indie/personal web is missing.
* It is easy to end up reading the same/similar review on multiple sites before finding unique/helpful content.
* Some sites are no-name brands that may have questionable practices \(e.g., not actually testing products that are reviewed, reviews that drive the viewer to the highest commission generating product\).
* Oftentimes the length of the articles and the details shared are of interest to search engines but unnecessarily verbose for humans.

## Query: "CNN" or "Fox News" or "{Organization Name}"

**Query**: _CNN_ or _Fox News_ or _{Organization Name}_

**Results**:

* Often dominated by the organization itself \(not entirely unreasonably\).
* Many organizations \(e.g. news\) have duplicate content from sites syndicating their content. Do we really want to see the same story from CNN, APNews, and MSNBC?
* One can use query operators to refine the results \(but how many people do you know who use them or are even aware that they exist?\). 
* Even if one uses query operators the number of sites that need to be excluded can become quite lengthy and must be recreated for each query.

## Query: {Medical Topic}

**Query**: {Any Medical Topic}

**Results**: Medical topics, oftentimes of critical importance to the searcher, return notoriously poor results. These results suffer from information that is:

* Incorrect - Oftentimes sincere, this information is untested and sometimes dangerous.
* Incomplete - Does not provide enough information for an individual to take informed action.
* Redundant - A number of larger medical sites provide primarily redundant information regarding the cause, diagnosis, treatment, prospects, etc.
* Commercial Information - Treatments of questionable value are marketed to individuals at high costs.

## Conclusion

We could go on _ad nauseum_ with examples of poor quality search results but we don't want to bore you.
