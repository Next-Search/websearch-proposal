# C.2. Presearch

{% hint style="info" %}
"...w_e believe there is a ton of room for disruption in the search space, and having some competition provided us with a sense of urgency and validated the market opportunity. We wish them all the best with their project._" - [Presearch](https://blog.goodaudience.com/presearch-the-anatomy-of-a-token-sale-9f4c31bc3f1f)
{% endhint %}

When Presearch was initially announced we were as excited as anyone by the potential for a new, high quality, open search engine entering the market. Things haven't developed as swiftly as we'd like and we believe we have a number of differentiators which would position us to better contend with Google.

We hope Presearch is able to build out their vision and do so successfully, in the meantime we think some open source competition wouldn't be bad for Presearch \(or us\). Here are a few ways we see ourselves as differentiated from Presearch:

## Centralization vs Decentralization

We hazard to guess one of the bigger challenges for Presearch is its commitment to a decentralized engine. While we think a decentralized search engine is great we also see the practical implementation while maintaining high quality, speedy, trustworthy results as being difficult.

## Use of Existing Blockchain Ecosystems

Presearch built their own token PRE. This adds a significant burden to Presearch which we'd like to avoid. We believe by using existing blockchain systems \(such as BAT\) we can expedite and simplify our development process.

## Ease of Contribution

Right now Presearch offers some limited ability to contribute to search results, but this requires development skills putting this out of reach for most users. We intend to start with a simple, intuitive contributor interface that will be accessible to all users and doesn't require any coding on the user's part.

## Method of Contribution

Presearch seems focused on contributions in two forms: \(a\) algorithmic and \(b\) subject experts. We will certainly welcome quality algorithmic contributions as well, it is on the subject experts matter that we differ most.

Presearch seems to be aiming for something similar to Jason Calacanis' Mahalo. While we believe there is value in this approach we don't want subject experts to have quite this amount of power. They will receive some initial boost in authority due to their domain expertise BUT their rankings will be considered in the context of all rankings. It seems Presearch may start with the expert curation method and then adopt a more general approach, we intend to use the more general approach from the start.

## Anti Spam

Kudos to Presearch on a pretty nifty anti-spam idea outlined in one of their [podcast interviews](https://medium.com/@presearch/presearch-on-the-cryptocanucks-podcast-fundamental-shifts-protecting-privacy-1e5d7b2474ca). Essentially they are looking at folks contribution an asset \(in a non-physical sense\) to lend authority to their claim and the loss of that asset if the claim is spammy. This is quite interesting!

We'll be taking a slightly different approach. While the above approach would allow individuals and organizations with more resources to stake spammy claims our emphasis on trust as the asset provides a much more level playing field for all parties.

## Structure

Presearch currently has one shareholder, the founder. NeSE would implement itself with a distributed ownership structure.

## Incentivization

Presearch gives tokens for searches, NeSE does not. As Presearch notes, the incentivization of searches tends to create opportunities for abuse:

> "_Since November 2017, we have welcomed more than 875,000 users. Each day millions of searches are performed. Unfortunately, a large number of those searches are flagged by our system as solely being performed for the sole intent of collecting tokens._" - [Presearch](https://medium.com/@presearch/https-medium-com-presearch-new-feature-rewards-verification-system-af39d7ed648e).

## Monetization

Presearch's primary monetization model appears to be [privacy-centric ads](https://medium.com/@presearch/newpresearchads-2a53b491d49). We can't say NeSE won't ever use ads but it is our intention to focus on attention based monetization - e.g. the sort of solutions Brave and Coil are delivering.

## Transparency

While there is significant information available on Presearch there is also a lot that seems to be missing. We intend to offer a much higher level of transparency with at least monthly reports on what we are up to.
