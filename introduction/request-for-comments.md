# Request for Comments

This document can be considered a Request for Comments \(RFC\). We believe we have a way forward but are eager to receive feedback from you. Are there questions we left unanswered? Is there somewhere our model is weak? Do you have suggestions regarding the stack we utilize to build this new search engine? Perhaps you are aware of books or articles you believe would be especially applicable to our project or of similar efforts we should be aware of - whatever it is, we want to hear from you!

You can provide your feedback in several ways:

* GitHub: [nextsearch/websearch-proposal](https://github.com/nextsearch/websearch-proposal)
* Twitter: [nextwebsearch](https://twitter.com/nextwebsearch)
* Email: [nextsearch@protonmail.com](mailto:nextsearch@protonmail.com)

We look forward to hearing from you!
