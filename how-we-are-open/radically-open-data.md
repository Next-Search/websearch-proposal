# Open Data

We will make the data we crawl and utilize for the search engine freely available. We are admirers of [CommonCrawl](http://commoncrawl.org/) and would like to provide a similar service \(or, if they'd have us, to work with them directly\). Our one primary change from CommonCrawl is that we'd like to make the data available through P2P means to remove the cost barrier one encounters currently when downloading CommonCrawl data from Amazon Web Services \(AWS\).
