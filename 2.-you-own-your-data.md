# 3. You Own Your Data

We will offer built-in hosting for your search data to make the user experience as smooth as possible BUT you won't be stuck with us. You'll be able to choose from a number of data storage hosts such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, and OneDrive. In fact you'll be able to store your data in almost any secure location whether that is a [SOLID Pod](https://solid.inrupt.com/), [Blockstack's Gaia](https://github.com/blockstack/gaia), or your own personal server.\[^1\]

We'll implement this data in an open format that other sources \(if you so choose\) can consume and hope to see search providers adding ingestion capabilities to their services for individuals who may want to move to a new service \(or sync between services\).
