# 10.1 Employees



We'd like to, for a few minutes, discuss our last point: care of employees. We believe:

1. That employees produce the most value when they have minimal stressors outside their career. This means providing a living wage, health benefits, generous sick/vacation policies, and health/comforted-optimized working environments.
2. That the tortoise will win the race over the hare and that we do not need to work excessive hours to deliver a quality product that can maintain market dominance over the long haul.
3. That employees are an invaluable asset and should be considered before increased financial value for the company - this means we won't cut staff to "save money" unless absolutely necessary.
4. That each individual has inherent worth and that no one individual can be worth infinitely more than another. As such, compensation for the lowest paid employee will be directly tied to the maximum compensation available to the highest paid employee.
